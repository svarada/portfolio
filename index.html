    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there, thanks for visiting my page! I’m Saipreeth — a data-driven analyst passionate about using analytics, automation, and strategy to solve real-world challenges.

I hold a Master’s in Business Analytics and dual undergraduate degrees in MIS and Finance. Currently at Highmark Health, I support provider interoperability and product strategy within the Epic Payer Platform, driving insights that improve care coordination and business outcomes.

From building SQL reports using Epic Caboodle and Clarity to leading RPA initiatives that saved over $4M, I’ve delivered scalable solutions across product and automation domains. I’ve also developed predictive models and Power BI dashboards that help leaders make faster, smarter decisions.

Whether translating stakeholder needs into features, streamlining data pipelines, or exploring generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini, I’m focused on creating impact through thoughtful, data-backed solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball, spending time with family, trying new food, and working on projects that bridge technology and human impact. </p>
